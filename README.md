# Monster-Hunt is a basic react app

## This app enabled me to understand basic react concepts. These concepts, made react standout in the year 2013 <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before react there was jquery library, anglar framework by google. These guys tried to make DOM manipulation <br/> easy and 
uniform across all browers. Although they took the imperative approach where the developer still had to <br/>directly mess 
with the DOM, they still made mapulation, event handling faster.<br/>
##
&nbsp; &nbsp; Angular by google came up with a framework that allowed developers build complex web apps, it provided <br/>
the necessary blocks which made development faster but there was a problem, diffrent parts of the app will <br/> affect other 
parts of the app in an unpredictable manner because of the multidirectional flow of data.

# React concepts that changed the game.
- Declarative
- Component based system
- Unidirectional flow of data 
# Declarative
The developers at facebook came up with the idea of a virtual DOM. The virtual DOM is painted by the react library all the developer
needs to do is to define the states of the web app then the react library wiil paint a blueprint using the current state of the 
app and the required component.The react bot is our worker tool who then manipulates the real DOM using the blueprint generated 
by the react library there by rendering what is intended. This way the developer does not need to touch the DOM as the react bot will handle 
this hence making life easier.
# Component based system
This system encourages the break down  of the app into smaller reusable units (components) , where these components can be used anywhere in the app as many times as needed
