# Monster-Hunt is a basic react app

This app enabled me to understand basic react concept. These concepts made react standout in the year 2013 <br/>
Before react we had jquery library, anglar framework by google. These guy tried to make DOM manipulation easy and <br/>
uniform across browers. Although they took the imperative approach where the developer still had to directly mess with the DOM, they still made mapulation,
<br/> event handling faster.
