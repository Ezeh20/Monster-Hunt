# Monster-Hunt is a basic react app

## This app enabled me to understand basic react concepts. These concepts, made react standout in the year 2013 <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before react there was jquery library, anglar framework by google. These guys tried to make DOM manipulation <br/> easy and 
uniform across all browers. Although they took the imperative approach where the developer still had to <br/>directly mess 
with the DOM, they still made mapulation, event handling faster.<br/>
##
&nbsp; &nbsp; Angular by google came up with a framework that allowed developers build complex web apps, it provided <br/>
the necessary blocks which made development faster but there was a problem, diffrent parts of the app will <br/> affect other 
parts of the app in an unpredictable manner because of the multidirectional flow of data.
