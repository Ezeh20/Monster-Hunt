# Monster-Hunt is a basic react app

## This app enabled me to understand basic react concepts. These concepts, made react standout in the year 2013 <br/>
Before react there was jquery library, anglar framework by google. These guys tried to make DOM manipulation easy <br/>and 
uniform across all browers. Although they took the imperative approach where the developer still had to directly <br/>mess 
with the DOM, they still made mapulation, event handling faster.
