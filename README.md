# Monster-Hunt is a basic react app

- This app enabled me to understand basic react concept. These concepts made react standout in the year 2013 <br/>
Before react there was jquery library, anglar framework by google. These guys tried to make DOM manipulation easy and <br/>
uniform across all browers. Although they took the imperative approach where the developer still had to directly mess <br/> 
with the DOM, they still made mapulation, event handling faster.
